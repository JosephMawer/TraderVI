TMX's GraphQL API uses session-based authentication via HTTP cookies. Your implementation correctly handles this:
 Automatic Cookie Persistence
•	TMX sets cookies (like session tokens) on first request
•	CookieContainer automatically attaches them to subsequent requests
•	No manual header management needed
 Mimics Browser Behavior
TMX expects clients to:
1.	Receive Set-Cookie headers
2.	Send those cookies back on future requests
This is exactly how browsers work, making your client less detectable as automated.




- Notes taken from: Granville's New Strategy of Daily Market Timing for Maximum Profit

"The advance-decline line (cumulative differential) is a technical tool based entirely on daily market statistics.  
It is simply the extension of the daily plurality of issues traded on a cumulative bases expressed in either a 
continuing column of figures or charted on a graph"

"The difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of declining issues is the daily plurality"

Plurality: Term employed in describing the total advances and declines, asigning the plurality to one or the other

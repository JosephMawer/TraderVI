TODO:
1) add retries on 'Unable to parse out price for 'x'' comment
	- ruggadize the whole parsing of the html stuff
	- add retry attempts


2) figure out the object null reference exception when parsing intraday stocks
	- something to do with running async concurrently,sigh...


3) start writing some calculations on the data collected
	- advance-decline line as shown in Granvilles book
	- calcualte top gainers for dollar, percentage, etc. as well as top losers, etc.

4) start calculating granvilles indicators

5) side off --- based on Granville's numeric weighting system can we calculate the optimal values?  and then compare the optimal to our results
that we get from analyzing current day to day stock information.  The closer we are to the optimal value the high chance of success the stock has

6) In the data layer (StocksDB) is it possible to create a generic reader so that I can just pass have a single method call, i.e. FetchData<T>()
   so that I can avoid having to write out the same ado.net code every method...


7) We need a way to validate the success/failure of the system by logging the daily market forecast each day and then checking how
accurate that forecast was the following day, i.e. did the market rise like it was supposed to?, did it fall like it was supposed to? etc.


8) Create a worker service (daemon) that sits in background executing tasks at predefined intervals

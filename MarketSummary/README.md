"The advance-decline line (cumulative differential) is a technical tool based entirely on daily market statistics.  
It is simply the extension of the daily plurality of issues traded on a cumulative bases expressed in either a 
continuing column of figures or charted on a graph"

"The difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of declining issues is the daily plurality"

Plurality: Term employed in describing the total advances and declines, asigning the plurality to one or the other
